# Photo app

A photo app displaying thumbnails of photos that are fetched from an API, using only vanilla JavaScript. The app should allow the user to view photos in a full-screen carousel mode as well.

View the hosted app [here](http://waneka.github.io).

### Setup
To view the app in a browser, simply open the `index.html` file in a browser of your choosing. That's it!

### Notes
I used the Pixabay public api for the photos. It is simple and easy to use. The photos are not titled on Pixabay, so I'm using the `tags` property instead of a title on the expanded photos.
